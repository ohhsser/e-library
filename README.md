ELibrary management system.


This project is aimed at providing an adequate and responsive means of borrowing your favorite choice of books from the library and also for authors who wish to put their books up for others to have a read/borrow. Setting up this platform, i aim to create to create a means for users to be able to login and sign up. I also aim to create an efficient system for admin to be able to add books into the system, update when a book is no longer available & also be able to delete a book totally from the catalogue. I aim to create an interface where users are able to effcetively search for their favorite books, select how long they would like to borrow it for and a return date. I also aim to implement a limitation to how many books a user can borrow at a time and also, the quality of the book will relate to how long the book can be borrowed for.

Essentially, this project aims to help book lovers effectively borrow their favorite book of choice for a certain period of time seamlessly.
